This is a competition submission I completed on DataCamp. The initial data set was provided, along with some questions to explore. I used Python to explore and clean the data and to analyze the data to respond to the research questions. The project involves using Python to sort and visualize data, compute summary statistics, fit linear and multi variate regressions and more. The whole project is presented in a Jupyter notebook.
